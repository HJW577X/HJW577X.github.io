My supervisors are [Prof. Zaiwen Feng](https://coi.hzau.edu.cn/info/1122/6168.htm) from the College of Informatics at Huazhong Agricultural University, [Prof. Michael Bewong](https://bjbs.csu.edu.au/schools/computing-mathematics-engineering/staff/profiles/senior-lecturers/michael-bewong) from the School of Computing, Mathematics & Engineering at Charles Sturt University, and [Prof. Selasi Kwashie](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/persons/selasi-kwashie) from the AI & Cyber Futures Institute at Charles Sturt University.

I'm working on data mining„ÄÅrepresentation learning on graph-structured data and applying them to downstream tasks e.g., link prediction and entity resolution. I also work on in-context learning of large language models.
