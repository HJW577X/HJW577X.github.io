**Abstract:** Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are gaining popularity as powerful tools for analysing complex networks with diverse node types often referred to as heterogeneous graphs. While existing HGNNs have been successfully used within the context of social and information networks, their application in biomedicine remains limited. Despite key biomedical data on drug-drug interaction (DDI), drug-target interaction (DTI), protein-protein interaction (PPI), and drug-disease association (DDA) rightfully fitting the criteria of complex heterogeneous graphs, there are only a handful of specialised techniques for analysing biomedical networks. These techniques do not leverage the relatively simpler and readily available generic HGNNs. In this study, we posit the utility of readily available generic HGNNs in addressing the link prediction tasks in biomedical settings. Thus, we conduct a benchmarking study of 42 techniques including nine generic HGNNs across eight biomedical datasets using several evaluation metrics. Our results show that the recently developed and readily available generic HGNNs achieve comparable and sometimes better results when compared with the specialised biomedical methods across all evaluation metrics. For instance the generic HGNN Simple-HGN achieves the best results in four of the eight datasets and shows equivalent performance to the biomedical methods on the remaining datasets. Furthermore, this work analyses and presents useful guidelines to practitioners on how to optimally set complex hyper-parameters which underpin the HGNNs. Finally, this work makes publicly available, via https://github.com/Zaiwen/Link_Prediction_in_Biomedical_Network, the benchmarking framework and source codes which underpin this study.
