**Abstract:** This paper studies the discovery of approximate rules in property graphs. First, we propose a semantically meaningful measure of error for mining graph entity dependencies (GEDs) that almost hold, to tolerate errors and inconsistencies that exist in real-world graphs. Second, we present a new characterisation of GED satisfaction, and devise a depth-first search strategy to traverse the search space of candidate GEDs efficiently. Further, we perform experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our solution, FastAGEDs, with three real-world graphs. The results show FastAGEDs is effective and efficient for mining approximate GEDs in noisy and erroneous real-world graphs.
