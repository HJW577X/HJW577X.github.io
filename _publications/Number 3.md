**Abstract:** Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is crucial for drug development and repositioning. Methods using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) for DTI prediction have become a promising approach, with attention-based models often achieving excellent performance. However, these methods typically overlook edge features when dealing with heterogeneous biomedical networks. We propose a heterogeneous network-based contrastive learning method called HNCL-DTI, which designs a heterogeneous graph attention network to predict potential/novel DTIs. Specifically, our HNCL-DTI utilizes contrastive learning to collaboratively learn node representations from the perspective of both node-based and edge-based attention within the heterogeneous structure of biomedical networks. Experimental results show that HNCL-DTI outperforms existing advanced baseline methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating strong predictive ability and practical effectiveness.
